React 

What is state?
Any data in your application that can change based on conditions .

Its data store that is use to manage the component data.

What is state management?

* iT´S the ability to control the information  that is passed between React components.
* State management is the process of determining how to manage state information in a web application
* State management can be used to track.
- user data
- session data
- Application data 
- Component data  


Types of data Sources?

We say 
* server data is a data that coems from an external Api or server, as a front developer.
* Global State, it simply means that data that we manage acrss multiple components.
* local state, and this refer to the data that we manage in a particular component.
  local state is form management.
* next source data is called you are state,and this data exists on new Urls, including the path 
name and query parameters. Let´s say that if yopu want to find a particular record or document
we nnormally pass the ID in the param.
* Routing and you are state and routing. it´s about local storage, it means that data from Browser API,
we normaly use local storage for authentication, meaning that we save the logging user into local storage,
or we can use local storage for cart management.

** Ways of managing state in react

- useState: is a hook for managing state in a particular component.
- useContext(): context API, and we also use context API for state management.
- Redux: 
- RTK: which mena redux toolkit
- RTK Query.

React TSate MAnagement Libraries

- ZOO stand
- Recoi 
- Jotaiu
- Redux. we are going to use 

 What is Redux?
 
 * Redux is an open-source JS library for managing and centralizing application state 
 *  A predictable State Container for JS aApps
 
 It means that it is a way to keep track of the different things that are happening in your application.
 and this helps to make sure that everithing happens in the right order and that your application doesn´t
 
 When to use redux?
 
 * Youi should use Redux when you have a complex state object that is difficult to manage with the local 
 state alone 
 * The app state is updated frequently
 * the logic to uopdate that state may be complex
 
 // benefits of using redux 
 
 * Predictable , it simply means that it helps the application to behave consistently in different enviroments,
 whether on the client side or server side, or because redux uses a strict unidirectional data flow.
 * Centralized state management: this means sthat it help to separate the application state and logic in one 
 plac eor redux lets you manage tou state in a central place.
 * Debuggable . Of using the built in use context API hook from  react.
 
 ** Redux important terms 
 If you don´t undertand the terms and don´t understand how it works.
 
 -- Actions, Actions are the driving force of every dynamic appliccation, as they the medium by which all changes 
 are comunicated within a Redux application.
 
 -- Reduicers, Reducers are event listeners which handle events absed on the action t ype
 
 -- AStore, it stores the application data
 
 ** How redux works Important.!!
 
 Action is teh driving force.
