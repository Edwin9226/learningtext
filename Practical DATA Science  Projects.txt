Practical DATA Science  Projects: From Analysis to Insights

In this project we will:

* Learn and understand about Regression 
* Learn how toi clean and process dataset (outlier, missing values, etc.)
* Learn about Correlation and feature selection
* Learn About Artificial neural Networks
* Deploy our mdell as a Flask Web APp


Predicting Diamon Sale Price using Neural Network Regression

X APrt 1 (i). Regression and multipe Linear Regression 

Regression is a method which measures the nature and extent of the relationship between two or more 
variables, thus enables us to make predictions.

Regresion data exist all around us, and within us as well:

- Teen Bith Rate and Poverty level Data 
- Rainfall measurements 
- Stock Prices 
- Number of sunspots
- Annual Rentail sales 
- Testig Automobiles

In this project, we are going to look at such a reression problem, predicting the sale price of a diamond.

X Part I(ii): Diamond and its Sales Price

A Diamond has various features and characteristics, which are measured and analysed to decide on a market value.
Let us look at some of them:

* Cut: refers to one of then 10 or so most comonm diamond cuts.
* Cololur: Clear diamonts are graded D-Z. This higher letter more yellowish but are often better values since 
colour is hard to determine once in a ring.
* Clarity: refers the inclusions (i.e, internal flaws) in the diamonds seen though a jewellerÂ´s loupe or
microscope. Fewer and smaleer are better.
* Eye-clean: refers to the blemishes or inclusions can see with the naked eye. There are 10 grades.

**-- About Dataset 

Here is a brief rundown of the columns as well as links to some background information to get you talking like an expert in no time.

- cut refers to one of the 10 or so most common diamond cuts. This dataset has an additional one called the
 'Cushion Modified'.
Diamond Shapes
- color Clear diamonds are graded D-Z. The higher letters more yellowish but are often better values since 
color is hard to determine once in a ring.
- clarity refers the inclusions (i.e., internal flaws) in the diamonds seen though a jewelers loupe or
 microscope. Fewer and smaller are better.
- carat_weight Refers to the mass of the diamond. It's loosely connected with dimension of a diamond but cut 
and cut_quality tends to play an equally large if not larger role.
- cut_quality refers the GIA Cut Grading System which was developed in 2005 and is de facto standard.
- lab is the grading lab. The big three are GIA, IGI and HRD. Each diamond gets a lab certificate that looks 
like this.
- polish and symmetry are what you would expect.
- eye-clean refers to the blemishes or inclusions can see with a the naked eye. There are 10 grades.
- culet_size is the size of the circle you'd see if you looked straight down. None is ideal because it 
affects the amount of light that gets reflected.
- culet_condition indicates if the culet has any chipping, which is why some diamonds don't close to a 
point but rather a very small flat spot.
- fancy_color_ columns have to do with colored diamonds. Formerly, extremely rare but now common, popular, 
and almost always lab grown.
- fluor columns refer to the effect of long wave UV light. According to GIA 25-35% have it; for ~10% of
 those it's noticeable to an expert.
- depth_percentandtable_percent are the relative measurements of the flat part of the top and the depth. 
This varies somewhat by cut.
- meas_length, meas_width, meas_depth are the absolute measurements of stone.
- girdle min/max are where the id of a stone is engraved they also are where the meets the setting and play 
a role in reflection. There are 9 values ranging from extremely thin to extremely thick
- fancy columns refer to colored diamonds. They can be natural like the extremely rare blue diamonds, or lab 
grown. The columns refer to the colors, secondary colors and their intensity.
- total_sales_price is priced in dollars.





X PArt I (iii): The Dataset 

* link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hrokrin/the-largest-diamond-dataset-currely-on-kaggle

* this dataset has 219703 samples of very kind of diamond 
* The task at hand Predicting the sale price in dollars.
* Let us explore the different features in the dataset and try to understand how we can proceed with model 
building.
