T he Session factory is a thread safe object and used by all yhe threads of an application.
We would need one SessionFactory object per database using a seaprate configuration

cachinng is a mechanism to enhancethe performance of a system. It is a buffer memory that lies 
between the application and the database. Cache memory stores recently used data items in order
to reduce the number of database hits as much as possible.

** // First Level  Cache
the First-level cache is the Session cache and is a mandatory cache through which all request  must pass.
The Session object keeps an object under its own power before committing it to the database.

** Second-level cache 
Secon level cache is an optional cache and first-levelcache will always be consulted before any attempt is

and per-collection basis and mainly responsible for caching objects across sessions.  

** // Query level cache 
Hibernate also implement a cache fro query resulsets that integrates closely whir the second level cache.

This is an optional feature and requires two additional physical cache regions that hold the cached
