Testing, allowing you to catch bugs, ensure your code function as intended, and provide confidence in the
reliability and stability of your applications.
Share time-tested recipes for success,and equip you with the tools and Knowledge you need to write 
pcomprehensive and effective test.

** Spring bott Testing Pitfalls
SB application effectively can d¿be a hurdle, 

** SB Testin gPitfall 1 : @Mock vs @MockBean
The objects our class under test depends on.

** SB Testing Pitfal 2: Extensive usage of @SpringBootTest

We should try to test and verify as much of our implemnttion as possible on a lower testin glevel.

We can ensure ou rSpring Secut¿rity configuration is working by using @WebMvcTest.

** TEsting pitfall 3 : Not testing allowing

how can we ever say it’s working? While we might have
checked our implementation manually, how can we ensure any upcoming
changes don’t break our feature? 

Whether we write the test before the implementation (aka. test-driven development)
 or afterward depends on personal preferences.
 I’ve had a great experience writing the
test first, leading to more thoughtful design and smaller steps.


The Spring Framework and Spring Boot emphasize the importance of testing and 
encourage us to write tests by having great testing support and tools.
