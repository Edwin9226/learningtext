A Functiona√±l Approachto JAva 

You will learn about the concepts and importance of the following aspects of FP: 

* Composition Build modular and easy composable blocks.
* Expressiveness: Write more concise code that clearly expresses its intent.
* SAfer code: Create safer data structures without side effects that don't need to deal with race
conditions or locks, which are hard to use without introducing bugs.
* Modularity: Break down larger  projects into more easily manageable modules.
* Maintainability: Use smalller functional block with less interconnection to make changes and refactoring 
safer without breaking other parts of your code.
* Data manipulation  : BUild efficient data manipulation pipelines wit less complexity.
* Performance: Immutability and predictability allow you to scale horizontally with paralelism without 
much thought about it.
