typpe 2: NAtive-API driver
Type 3: Network- Protocol Driver(Middleware driver)
Type 4: Database-Protocol Driver (Pure JAva Driver)

Which driver should be used?
•	 If you are accessing one type of database, such as Oracle, Sybase, or IBM, the
preferred driver type is 4.
•	 If your Java application is accessing multiple types of databases at the same
time, type 3 is the preferred driver.
•	 Type 2 drivers are useful in situations where a type 3 or type 4 driver is not
available for your database yet.
•	 The type 1 driver is not considered a deployment-level driver and is typically
used for development and testing purposes only.
•	 Apart from the four drivers listed by the sun recently, there is a type 5 driver
