Automatically check if the code is correct, if the website still works as it should , and then, maybe,
update the live website with those changes. All of this, without any human intervention.

** What are actions?

Actions are predefined pieces of code that perform specific tasks, Instead of reinventing the wheel
every time, the Elopers can use these actions to automate common processes, amking their workflows 
more efficient and streamlined.

Testing a piece of software, an action might be i place to autoamtically 
deplo that software to a live server, making it available for users worldwide.

Actions are ready-to-use components that carry out specialized tasks. It´s a specific instruction, a 
singular action to be performed. Within a broader process, steps are ther building blocks that ensure 
everything comes together correctly. 

* Check the neww code for errors 
* Merge this new code with the existing one
* Notify the team that the update was succesful

Steps are the individual tasks that make up  a large process.

A software process relies on each step being correctly exeuted. they are the fundamental  building blocks 
ensuring eerithing works as it should 


** What are jobs?
Jobs aredistinct unit of work that can be executed. They can run one after the other or asometimes even at 
the same time, depending on the requirements. jobs are the segments or chunks that make up a large process.
Just as a realy team can´t with without each runner doing their part, a software workflow depends on each 
job being executed correctly and efficiiently 

they are the individual, crucial segments ensuring the entire process is succesful



** What are runners?
it´s the enviroment or machine where specific tasks, jobs, or operations are carried out.
Runners are the platforms or machines that execute the tasks we set for them.


** Continuous Deployment (CD)

- CD autokmatically deploys your code to productioin withut maual intervention
- CD is like having a personañ chef who always serves you the best meal.
- Personal Chefs use the freshest ingredients, just  as CD uses the latest and greatest code to ensure your app 
is  up-to-date and running smoothly
- CD takes care of the entire deployment process, from testing to mnitoring production 
- With CD, you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the best version  of your app served fresh every time.



** Event-Driven Workflows 


- Event-dribven Workflows in GIthub Actions trigger automatically base on specific events, just like a party
celebrates something special.
- Automation in event-driven workflows ensures smooth and efficient running 
- Custom workflows can be  created based on specific conditions to customize the development process in 
unique and creative ways
- Examples of event-driven workflows include automatically running tests when code is pushed or automatically 
deploying a ne wversion of software when a new release is created.
- Jump on board the ecvent-driven workflow train with Github Actions for a better development process
and happier party guests!
