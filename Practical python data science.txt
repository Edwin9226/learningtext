Practical python data science

Data Science is a fat-emerging field of study and research.
There are several things happening concurrently in the IT domain.

1.- With the surging popularity of digitalizacio an Â¿d edge technology,
3. There is a faster maturity and stability of scores of connectivity technologies, it
is anticipated that there will be billions of connected embedded systems
4. With the wider acceptance and adoption of the microservices architecture (MSA)
and event-driven architecture (EDA) patterns for producing and sustaining
enterprise-scale applications, there is a rapid rise in the number of usable and
reusable event-driven microservices
With the purposeful interactions between digitized entities, connected devices
and interoperable microservices, there is a massive amount of multi-structured
data getting produced, collected, cleansed, and crunched meticulously
6. There are data analytics and science platforms in plenty to discover and
disseminate knowledge out of data heaps
The implications of the various digital technologies and tools are given below. In
the years ahead, we will be bombarded with
!" Millions of microservices;
!" Billions of connected devices;
!" Trillions of digital entities

However, if generated data are not subjected to a series of deeper investigations to 
squeeze out actionable insights in the time, then the data goes off wastefully.

Precisely speaking, every data (internal and external) being produced by any establishment has
 to be meticulously collected, processed, and mined in order to realize the much-needed cognition not only
 for human beings in their everyday decisions, deals, and deeds but also for devices and
machines to be intelligent in their operations, outputs, and offerings

Python is emerging as the leading programming language for data science projects.

 The following libraries are enabling data science
applications and are made available in Python:
1. NumPy: This is a library that makes a variety of mathematical and statistical
operations easier and faster. This is also the basis for many features of the Pandas
library.
2. Pandas:*8,!3*9:%,)$*6!;/(/:*!3*'/#(%#"*34#'!&'(66:*%)*.('!6!%(%#*+)/<!$0*+!%,*
data. This is one of the gamechangers for the tremendous success of data science
projects.
3. Matplotlib: This is a visualization library that makes it quick and easy to
generate charts from data.
4. Scikit-Learn: This is the most popular library for machine learning (ML) work
in Python.
There are dedicated chapters for producing machine learning applications. 

This book is being prepared with the intention of empowering
data scientists with all the vital details about programming using the Python language.

-** Introduction
Digital innovations and disruptions are frequently and feverishly happening in the
business domain these days.
In this chapter, we are discussing the prominent domains, which are gaining
immensely through the unique capabilities of Python.

1.4 Artifiial Intelligece AI applications.

The domain of data science (DS) is gaining surging popularity these days as it
has the wherewithal to discover knowledge out of massive amount of multistructured data.
 AI algorithms, especially machine and deep learning (ML/
DL) algorithms contribute immensely for the spectacular success of the DS
domain

Having understood this need, there came a number of unique libraries
as enumerated below:
H* SciPy for scientific and tecnical computing 
H* Pandas for data analysis and manipulation;
H* Kerass for artificial neural networks (ANNs)
H* TensorFlow for ML tasks and deep neural networks (DNNs);
H* NumPy for complex mathematical functions and computation;
H* Scikit-learn for working with various ML models.
